# FSJS-Project - old

This is the repo for what was going to be my project for Code Louisville Full Stack Javascript.

It is a basic html website for Jtown Academy childcare in Jeffersontown, Ky.

It will have a simple site to check children in and out providing time stamp logs.

It is planned to have all info pertaining to its services.
A photo carousel including its company logo.
An inquire form that will send contact information to the owners.
